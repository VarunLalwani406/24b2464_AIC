AI has always fascinated me , whether it be veo 3 by Google or chatgpt , but for its potential to solve real-world problems.My motivation for joining the Artificial Intelligence Community is to get myself into a collaborative environment where I can learn from experienced seniors, build, and grow with like-minded peers. I believe that this will challenge me to strive harder.
