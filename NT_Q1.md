AI Hackathon Preparation Plan<br>
 Week 1: Ideation & Problem Formulation<br>
Objective: Define a clear, impactful problem statement and assemble your team.<br>

Team Formation: Gather a diverse team with skills in data science, domain knowledge, and project management.<br>

Problem Selection: Choose a problem that aligns with your team's interests and skills. Ensure it's specific, measurable, and achievable within the hackathon timeframe.<br>

Quantitative Formulation: Translate the problem into a machine learning task (e.g., classification, regression). Define input features and target variables.<br>

Success Metrics: Decide on evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1-score, or RMSE to measure your model's performance.<br>

Deliverables:<br>

Finalized problem statement<br>

Defined evaluation metrics<br>

Team roles and responsibilities assigned<br> <br>

Week 2: Data Acquisition & Preprocessing<br>
Objective: Obtain and prepare data suitable for your problem.<br>

Data Sourcing: Identify and collect relevant datasets from open sources like Kaggle, UCI, or government databases.<br>

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.<br>

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.<br>

Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to prevent overfitting.<br>

Deliverables:<br>

Cleaned and preprocessed dataset<br>

Documented data preprocessing steps<br>

Feature list with descriptions<br> <br>

 Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Modeling<br>
Objective: Understand data patterns and build baseline models.<br>

EDA: Use visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to explore data distributions and relationships.<br>

Baseline Modeling: Implement simple models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to establish a performance benchmark.<br>

Model Selection: Choose appropriate algorithms based on data characteristics and baseline results.<br>

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters using techniques like grid search or random search.<br>

Deliverables:<br>

EDA report with insights and visualizations<br>

Baseline model performance metrics<br>

Selected model with tuned hyperparameters<br> <br>

Week 4: Finalization & Presentation<br>
Objective: Refine your solution and prepare for the hackathon presentation.<br>

Model Evaluation: Assess model performance on the test set and compare it with baseline results.<br>

Documentation: Prepare comprehensive documentation covering problem definition, data preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and results.<br>

Presentation: Create a compelling presentation highlighting your approach, findings, and impact.<br>

Rehearsal: Practice delivering your presentation within the allotted time, anticipating potential questions.<br> <br>

Deliverables:<br>

Final model and evaluation metrics<br>

Complete project documentation<br>

Presentation slides<br> <br>

Team Roles & Responsibilities<br>
Project Manager: Oversees the project timeline and coordinates team activities.<br>

Data Engineer: Handles data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing.<br>

Data Scientist: Conducts EDA and develops machine learning models.<br>

Domain Expert: Provides insights into the problem context and ensures solution relevance.<br>

Presenter: Leads the preparation and delivery of the final presentation.<br> <br>

 Risk Mitigation Strategies<br>
Time Constraints: Set internal deadlines for each phase to stay on track.<br>

Data Issues: Have backup datasets in case of data unavailability or quality problems.<br>

Technical Challenges: Allocate time for troubleshooting and seek mentorship when needed.<br>

Team Coordination: Maintain regular communication through meetings and collaborative tools.<br>
